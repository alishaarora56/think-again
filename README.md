# think-again

ðŸ¤—**Introduction** 
Think Again aims to prevent suicide by detecting suicidal ideation in social media content and intervening. Think Again is a project developed by Alisha Arora, who conceived the initial proof of concept and is executing the implementation of the model. 


ðŸ’¡**Motivation**
Over the past decade rates of suicide in teens have increased. More than 30% of youth in the US alone are at risk to suiciding in the next 10 years. With COVID-19 these numbers have only exacerbated. As we have entered the digital age, youth feel more comfortable speaking out about what they are feeling online than to loved ones. Therefore it is important to provide intervention in order to best support youth, the future of tomorrow.

ðŸŽ¯**Goals**
Within the next 3 months, we aim to:

* Iterate model through working with researchers, create a open source data collection strategy and beta test model 
* Start deploying model in platforms, empowering platforms around the world to collaborate in tackling suicide prevention
* Raise greater awareness around suicide prevention
